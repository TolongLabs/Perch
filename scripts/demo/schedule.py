"""Push narration starts later so no line is spoken over the next one.

A beat offset says when a moment happens on screen. It says nothing about how
long the line describing it takes to read, and `narrate.sh` mixed every segment
at its beat with no check between them -- so a line longer than the gap to the
next beat played *underneath* it. Two of six lines did that in the launch cut,
and the overlap is inaudible to every mechanical check we run: level, clipping,
silence and dynamics are all normal when two voices are talking at once.

Beats stay authoritative for the EARLIEST a line may start. This only ever moves
a line later, and only far enough to clear the one before it, so narration still
tracks the picture rather than drifting free of it.
