// Demo capture. Records the page, not the screen: no window chrome, no

// This file is the RUNNER and knows nothing about our product. It launches a
// browser, records video, and hands `walk.mjs` the tools to drive the page and
// mark beats. Everything product-specific lives in walk.mjs, which is the file
// you edit as the app changes.
//
// Writes beats.json alongside the capture: the wall-clock offset of every moment
// worth narrating. narrate.sh reads it, so narration lands on the beat even when
// a page gets slower. Hand-tuned millisecond offsets drift the moment anything
// upstream changes, and a narration that contradicts the picture is worse than
// silence.
