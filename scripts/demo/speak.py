"""Narration voice for the demo video. Chatterbox by default, Kokoro as the fallback.

Piper was the shortcut and it is audibly synthetic. The owner asked for an anime
voice, which is a real constraint rather than a flourish: it sets the register of
the whole video, and the wrong one makes a food product sound like a compliance
training module.

**Why jf_nezumi, measured rather than guessed.** Eight candidates were
synthesised on the same line, then scored two ways: median fundamental frequency
for register, and word error rate from an independent ASR pass for
intelligibility. Adult female speech sits near 165-200 Hz and anime voice acting
near 250-350 Hz, so pitch alone favoured jf_alpha at 273 Hz -- but jf_alpha is
the *least* intelligible of the eight at 50% WER ("Every kick shows the post").

    voice        F0     WER
    jf_alpha    273Hz   50%
    jf_nezumi   242Hz   14%   <- chosen
    bf_lily     200Hz   29%
    af_bella    198Hz   29%
    af_sky      155Hz   29%

jf_nezumi is in register and is the clearest of every voice tested. Across the
real script it scores 5%, and its only error is hearing "MakanLah" as "Makan La"
-- which is how the words are actually pronounced.

A phonetic respelling was tried and made it worse (7%), turning "Makan" into
"Mark on". The raw text wins; do not re-add a hint without re-measuring.

Licence matters as much as sound. Kokoro is Apache 2.0 and Chatterbox is MIT.
XTTS v2, F5-TTS and Fish Speech all sound good and are all non-commercial. Check
the licence before the voice.

**The table above was measured on another project's script, not this one.** It is
carried over as the reason the fallback voice is `jf_nezumi` rather than as a
claim about our narration. Re-measure before trusting it here.
