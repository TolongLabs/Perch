"""Builds the burned-in subtitle track from the same lines.json the narration
uses, so the words on screen and the words being spoken cannot drift apart.

Timing comes from two measured things and nothing hand-tuned: the beat offset
record.mjs recorded, and the real duration of the wav piper or kokoro produced
for that line. A subtitle that outlives its audio is worse than none -- it
asserts a claim the video is no longer making.

Long lines are split into readable cards rather than shrunk. Two lines of ~42
characters is the broadcast convention and it is a convention because it is
what a person can read in one glance while also watching a picture.
