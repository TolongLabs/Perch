# Agent Tooling: RTK And Graphify

Standing reference, moved out of `AGENTS.md` so it is not reloaded into every session. Both tools are **optional and
per-machine**: neither is a dependency of this repo, and every command below works without them.

| Tool         | Check            | If Missing                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **RTK**      | `which rtk`      | Run commands unprefixed. Nothing else changes |
| **Graphify** | `which graphify` | Navigate the codebase with grep and Read      |

## RTK (Rust Token Killer)

### Golden Rule

**Only if `rtk` is installed** (`which rtk`). Not every teammate has it. If it is missing, run commands directly and
ignore this whole section.

**Prefix commands with `rtk`.** If RTK has a filter for that command it uses it, otherwise it passes through unchanged.
It is always safe to use.

Use it inside chains too:

```bash
# Wrong
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# Correct
rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg" && rtk git push
```

### Commands That Matter Here

```bash
rtk git status / log / diff / add / commit / push    # 59 to 80 percent smaller
rtk gh pr view <n> / pr checks / issue list          # 26 to 87 percent
rtk tsc                                              # TS errors grouped by file
rtk lint                                             # Biome violations grouped
rtk bun run test                                     # failures only
rtk ls / read / grep / find                          # 60 to 75 percent
rtk err <cmd>                                        # errors only from any command
rtk gain                                             # savings so far
```

Git and `gh` passthrough works for every subcommand, including ones not listed.

`rtk` does not defeat the git guard. `.claude/hooks/guard-git.sh` matches on the command substring, so
`rtk git push origin main` and `rtk git add .env` are both blocked exactly like their bare forms. Verified 2026-08-26.

It **does** defeat the `permissions.deny` list in `.claude/settings.json`, which is prefix-matched:
`Bash(git push --force*)` does not match `rtk git push --force`. The hook is what actually stops that one, which is why
both exist.

## Graphify: Codebase Knowledge Graph

### Golden Rule

**Only if `graphify` is installed** (`which graphify`). Not every teammate has it. If it is missing, ignore this section
and navigate the codebase normally.

Graphify builds a persistent, queryable map of the project so you answer architecture questions from a compact graph
instead of grepping and reading many files.

### When to Use It

If `graphify-out/graph.json` exists, treat architecture and relationship questions ("how does X work", "what calls Y",
"trace the data flow") as a **`graphify query` first**, before grep or read:

```bash
graphify query "how does the router client reach config"   # BFS over the graph
graphify query "..." --budget 1500                          # cap the answer
graphify path "ApiClient" "loadConfig"                    # shortest path
graphify explain "SomeNode"                                 # plain-language summary
```

Then drop to grep or Read for exact `file:line` evidence. **The graph gives you the file, not the line.**

**Applies to every agent**, subagents included.

### Building and Refreshing

```bash
graphify .              # first build, about a minute, roughly 6 cents
graphify . --update     # incremental, after notable code changes
```

`graphify-out/` is derived and gitignored, so it is per-checkout and regenerating is on you. Scope is set by
`.graphifyignore`, which excludes config, `docs/`, agent instructions and vendored skills — a graph full of prose and
dependency entries dilutes every query run against it.

**Not worth building on the bare scaffold.** Build it once there is real code.

## Machine Gotchas

Two findings from 8 September that fail silently and look plausible. Both cost every session on the machine time.

**`--disable-dev-shm-usage` starves headless Chrome here.** The flag moves Chrome's shared memory off `/dev/shm` and
onto `/tmp`. On this machine `/tmp` is a 1 GB tmpfs that runs near full, while `/dev/shm` is 1 GB and almost empty, so
the flag aims the compositor at the one filesystem with no room. Symptoms: `Unable to capture screenshot`,
`Target crashed`, `ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`, tracking raster area rather than free RAM, unchanged by adding swap.
Drop the flag; it is Docker advice for a 64 MB `/dev/shm`, the inverse of this machine. Keep scratch output out of
`/tmp` for the same reason: write captures and bundles under `~/.cache/`.

**`ps -e` with `-C` unions, it does not intersect.** `ps -eo comm -C chrome-headless` returns every process on the
machine, looking exactly like a list of browsers; it once reported 343 browsers when there were 2, and nearly produced a
kill list covering every session here. Count with `pgrep -c chrome-headless`, or `ps -C chrome-headless --no-headers`
without `-e`.
