 *
 * They are not the same shape: the Tokyo clip is 16:9 and the birds are 16:7, because the strip along the bottom of
 * the birds carried the generator's sparkle and cropping it was cleaner than painting over the branch. `cover` is
 * what makes that not matter, at the cost of the sides of the wider one.

 * Two clips in turn, crossing at the loop point. A single looping video snaps back to its first frame, and the cut
 * is the one moment on the page a reader's eye is drawn to something that is not the argument. The next clip starts
 * under the current one and the current one fades off it, so the seam is a dissolve rather than a jump.
 *
 * Two elements rather than one with a swapped source: a source swap has to buffer, and the buffer is the cut.
